# August: a new detective game 

To make requests to the OpenAI API, you need to use your API key and organization name (if applicable). To avoid exposing your API key in your Unity project, you can save it in your device's local storage.

To do this, follow these steps:

- Create a folder called `.openai` in your home directory (e.g. `C:User\UserName\` for Windows or `~\` for Linux or Mac)
- Create a file called auth.json in the `.openai` folder
- Add an `api_key` field and a organization field (if applicable) to the `auth.json` file and save it

Here is an example of what your `auth.json` file should look like:
```
{
    "api_key": "sk-...W6yi",
    "organization": "org-...L7W"
}
```
